REPOSITORY FOR HOMOLOGY MODELS FOUND IN THE VISION VARIATION DATABASE

This repository has selected collection of structures for genes found in the Vision Variation Database. Each model has at least a 30% sequence identity and was taken from SWISS-MODEL (http://swissmodel.expasy.org) and ModBase (http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/index.cgi). These models were then refined using the FFX force field. More information can be found by visiting the following URL: http://ffx.biochem.uiowa.edu.
